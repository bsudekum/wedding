<p>A junior at University of Vermont, Johnny is as passionate about journalism as he is about skiing. Because what’s good for one Sudekum Brother is good for the other, Johnny and his friends live off campus in “The Buffalo,” the same house that Bobby lived in when he attended UVM. Since it only makes sense, Johnny also lives in Bobby’s old room.</p>

<p>You won’t find a better breakfast sandwich than one from The Buffalo’s kitchen, thoughtfully prepared by Chef Sudekum. Johnny loves balsamic vinegar, classic rock, playing guitar and is definitely the most lovable Sudekum.</p>

<p>Johnny is currently studying in Costa Rica, living with locals, practicing his Spanish and studying agriculture.</p>
