    	<h1>Adrianne Painter</h1>
        <h3>Niece of the Groom, Flower Girl</h3>
    	<p>As the first Painter grandchild, Adriane is one well-loved toddler. A true Painter in every sense of the word, she can out eat most grown adults and not gain an ounce all while topping the height charts in the 99th percentile.  

She loves playing, screaming in jubilation when the puppies appear on screen in 101 Dalmatians, and pronouncing new words. Her most recent articulation is “Uncle David,” which melts her Uncle’s heart every time.  And, when she throws in a “Go Blue,” she’s just showing off.</p>

    	<h1>Johnny Sudekum</h1>
        <h3>Brother of the Bride, Bridesman</h3>
    	<p>A junior at University of Vermont, Johnny is as passionate about journalism as he is about skiing. Because what’s good for one Sudekum Brother is good for the other, Johnny and his friends live off campus in “The Buffalo,” the same house that Bobby lived in when he attended UVM. Since it only makes sense, Johnny also lives in Bobby’s old room. 

You won’t find a better breakfast sandwich than one from The Buffalo’s kitchen, thoughtfully prepared by Chef Sudekum. Johnny loves balsamic vinegar, classic rock, playing guitar and is definitely the most lovable Sudekum. 

Johnny is currently studying in Costa Rica, living with locals, practicing his Spanish and studying agriculture. </p>

    	<h1>Bobby Sudekum</h1>
        <h3>Brother of the Bride, Bridesman</h3>
    	<p>A talented and passionate web engineer at Mapbox, Lauren and David are fully convinced that Bobby will be extremely famous, wealthy and successful within the decade. Always working on a “project,” Bobby’s work ranges from online maps, data analysis, mobile apps (he sold his first at age 24), and website building. 

Bobby excels at Lego and IKEA furniture building, downhill skiing and sleeping--anywhere, anytime. A budding mixologist (under the tutelage of his future brother-in-law), Bobby has a new-found passion for Manhattans and a never-ending passion for his belt--just ask. 

Bobby just made his second cross-country move in less than 18 months and says he is never again leaving his beloved San Francisco. </p>

    	<h1>Matthew Painter</h1>
        <h3>Brother of the Groom, Groomsman</h3>
    	<p>Matthew is a Sociology Professor at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming.  A true family man, when he’s not doing his research or watching Twilight (seriously), he is spending time with wife Jennifer and daughter Adriane.  He is also impatiently awaiting the expansion of his family in April with the addition of baby number two, affectionately known as B2.

Matthew’s love for his family is only distantly rivaled by his love for the mountains, specifically the Sangre de Cristos in New Mexico.  He spent seven summers in these hills as a camper or staffer at Philmont Scout Ranch, easily his favorite place on earth.  Lauren and David were able to join Matthew and Jennifer at the Ranch this past November to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary at the Ranch where they met.  Great times were had by all.
