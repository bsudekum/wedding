As the first Painter grandchild, Adriane is one well-loved toddler. A true Painter in every sense of the word, she can out eat most grown adults and not gain an ounce all while topping the height charts in the 99th percentile.  

She loves playing, screaming in jubilation when the puppies appear on screen in 101 Dalmatians, and pronouncing new words. Her most recent articulation is “Uncle David,” which melts her Uncle’s heart every time.  And, when she throws in a “Go Blue,” she’s just showing off.
