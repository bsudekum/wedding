Matthew is a Sociology Professor at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming.  A true family man, when he’s not doing his research or watching Twilight (seriously), he is spending time with wife Jennifer and daughter Adriane.  He is also impatiently awaiting the expansion of his family in April with the addition of baby number two, affectionately known as B2.

Matthew’s love for his family is only distantly rivaled by his love for the mountains, specifically the Sangre de Cristos in New Mexico.  He spent seven summers in these hills as a camper or staffer at Philmont Scout Ranch, easily his favorite place on earth.  Lauren and David were able to join Matthew and Jennifer at the Ranch this past November to celebrate their 6th wedding anniversary at the Ranch where they met.  Great times were had by all.
