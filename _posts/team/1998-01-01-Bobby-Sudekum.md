A talented and passionate web engineer at Mapbox, Lauren and David are fully convinced that Bobby will be extremely famous, wealthy and successful within the decade. Always working on a “project,” Bobby’s work ranges from online maps, data analysis, mobile apps (he sold his first at age 24), and website building. 

Bobby excels at Lego and IKEA furniture building, downhill skiing and sleeping--anywhere, anytime. A budding mixologist (under the tutelage of his future brother-in-law), Bobby has a new-found passion for Manhattans and a never-ending devotion to his belt--just ask.

Bobby just made his second cross-country move in less than 18 months and says he is never again leaving his beloved San Francisco.
