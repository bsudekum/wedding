A talented and passionate web engineer, Lauren and David are fully convinced that Bobby will be extremely famous, wealthy and successful within the decade. Always working on a “project,” Bobby’s work ranges from online maps, data analysis, mobile apps (he sold his first at age 24), and website building. 

For many years, strangers mistook Bobby for Lauren’s boyfriend since they loved holding hands.
